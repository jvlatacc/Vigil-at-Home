# through your desktop's password dialog (pkexec), or you can run it yourself:
#   sudo sh <Vigil's resources>/helper/linux/install.sh
# Its one optional argument is the AppImage Vigil runs from, which the helper
# pins (by device and inode) as the app it was installed for.
# Everything it installs is root-owned, so nothing running as you can change
# what runs as root. uninstall.sh (next to this file) reverses it.
