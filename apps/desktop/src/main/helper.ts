   * parts (detection.list.set), so no single line ever carries a big feed:
   * the helper caps its lines, and a rules sync that carried lists inline

   * then refused (a declined password dialog). If the helper still lacks a
   * list (it says so and changes nothing), that list goes on and the sync is
   * sent again.
   *
   * If the rules turn something off or add an exception, the helper asks for
   * the admin password first; a cancelled dialog throws a HelperCallError
   * with code refused and leaves the helper's rules as they were. With
   * `hold`, that password is asked for by the next dialog instead (a
   * release's) or by approveHeld(). With `ask: false` no dialog is shown:
   * a sync that needs the password resolves 'needs_password' and changes
   * nothing. `syncId` names the sync, so rulesState() can tell whether it
   * went in after the app stopped waiting.
