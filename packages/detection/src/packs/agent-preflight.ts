/**
 * Pre-flight rules: an agent's hook (Claude Code's PreToolUse) asks Vigil
 * before a tool runs, and these rules answer. Block mode denies the step,
 * alert mode asks the person, shadow only records, and no match leaves the
 * agent's own permission prompt in charge. Vigil never answers "allow".
 *
 * Each request is checked with `engine.check`, which leaves no trace, so
 * these rules cannot run actions, count, or learn what is "first seen"
 * (the linter enforces it). Only two rules deny out of the box: sending
 * credentials away and switching off the protections that watch the agent.
